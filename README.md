This is a multiple distorted High dynamic range Omnidirectional Image Database (NBU-HOID) containing JPEG XT encoding distortion and tone mapping distortion, which will be publicly available for academic needs in the future. The original source of the database is the Multimedia Signal Processing Laboratory of Ningbo University and is recognized in any publication that uses the database for research. The database will be referenced as :Liuyan Cao, Gangyi Jiang, Zhidi Jiang, Mei Yu, Yubin Qi, and Yo-sung Ho "Visual Quality Measurement for High Dynamic Range Omnidirectional Image Systems", In the process of submission. Please refer to the above document for details.
The Baidu Cloud download link of the NBU-HOID dataset is https://pan.baidu.com/s/1lzr7NUqhfQJb4gxyAE5cJA, and the corresponding passcord for database extraction is lx5g.
